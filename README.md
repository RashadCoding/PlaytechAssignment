# PlaytechAssignment

### How taask was resolved ###

The objective was to test for the presence of the "Development QA Engineer (Intern)" text in the Internship tab of https://www.playtech.ee/ website.
The selenium test opens the webpage, and then navigate to the Internship page by clicking on the Internship button after moving towards it with coordinates.
Then on the Internship page, the page source code is scanned for the aformentioned text's presence and the test verifies that it does not exist.
